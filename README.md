# main objective
create a website that allows the user to browse the company (nazhaev weaponry) armory and store.
make a nice website using css, js, and do backend stuff with php and sql.

# issues
## first issue:
how am i gonna include mysql to this??? i'm writing this in vs code with no actual knowledge on how to host a local website. i should probably figure this out first.
- (Index-1A) i have moved this from using an extension (Live Server) in vs code to using the WAMP project.
    i do not have a linux machine (as of yet, I'll probably end up converting my server to it, soon.) so I had to use WAMP to suffice.
> issue solved.

# things i learned
## !DOCTYPE
i thought this thing was not that important, apparently i was wrong; it is used for making sure that a browser formats the page in a standard fashion. from now on, i'll properly have my HTML files in such a fashion.
